# `PolarityInversion`

_Added in v0.11.0_

Flip the audio samples upside-down, reversing their polarity. In other words, multiply the
waveform by -1, so negative values become positive, and vice versa. The result will sound
the same compared to the original when played back in isolation. However, when mixed with
other audio sources, the result may be different. This waveform inversion technique
is sometimes used for audio cancellation or obtaining the difference between two waveforms.
However, in the context of audio data augmentation, this transform can be useful when
training phase-aware machine learning models.
