# `SevenBandParametricEQ`

_Added in v0.24.0_

Adjust the volume of different frequency bands. This transform is a 7-band
parametric equalizer - a combination of one low shelf filter, five peaking filters
and one high shelf filter, all with randomized gains, Q values and center frequencies.

Because this transform changes the timbre, but keeps the overall "class" of the
sound the same (depending on application), it can be used for data augmentation to
make ML models more robust to various frequency spectrums. Many things can affect
the spectrum, like room acoustics, any objects between the microphone and
the sound source, microphone type/model and the distance between the sound source
and the microphone.

The seven bands have center frequencies picked in the following ranges (min-max):

* 42-95 hz
* 91-204 hz
* 196-441 hz
* 421-948 hz
* 909-2045 hz
* 1957-4404 hz
* 4216-9486 hz
